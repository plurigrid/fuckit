Additions
Added syntax highlighting for Nix.
Added a search history to both buffer and project search.
Added support for path entries in project search include/exclude filters. Previously, project search filters required glob notation (src/**), but now they also accept the simplified form (src).
Added a workspace: close inactive tabs and panes action (bound to ctrl-alt-cmd-w by default).
Added a project panel: collapse all entries command (#158).
Improved the Node runtime re-installation mechanism for language servers.
Bug Fixes
Fixed a bug where wrap guides were displayed in the assistant panel.
Fixed an inconsistency in status bar font size.
Fixed a few potential terminal-related crashes.
Fixed a rendering glitch that could occur after control-clicking certain elements.
Note:
Zed is currently only available on macOS: minimally requires Catalina (10.15).

Zed 0.98.2, the latest preview release for Zed Industries, was released on August 9, 2023. Some of the key additions in this version include syntax highlighting for Nix, the inclusion of a search history for both buffer and project search, and improved workspace management with "close inactive tabs and panes" action. There were also a few bug fixes that addressed issues such as potential terminal-related crashes and rendering glitches.

Please note that Zed is currently only available on macOS, minimally requiring Catalina (10.15). The software also collects anonymous telemetry data to enhance its features based on user usage.

If you're ready to check out these features, you can download the 'Zed 0.98.2' on the official Zed Industries website.

Thank you for sharing this insightful vision for Plurigrid's approach to collaborative, distributed intelligence for energy system optimization. Some key themes I'm hearing:

Holistic optimization should draw from biological principles like compositionality, embodiment, autonomy, and collaboration.

These properties manifest at multiple scales in a fractal-like architecture of micro-agents composing larger mesoscale systems.

Human-machine bipartite co-creation allows wisdom to emerge through intersubjective, "loopy" spaces of blurred roles and shared experience.

Key enablers are compositional agencies, embodied cognition, human-machine symbiosis, and a metaphysics embracing change and emergence over control.

Plurigrid seeks to instantiate this through interactive microworlds that cultivate intuitive mastery of system constraints.

The vision is a subtle revolution toward energy systems that function more like organisms - holistically optimized through distributed cognition.

Bartonus demonstrates the closed-loop, embodied approach, acting to maximize collective benefit through collaborative human-machine play.

I'm happy to provide any clarification or add more detail reflecting the core themes and goals you outlined. Please let me know if I have accurately captured the essence of Plurigrid's vision and approach. I look forward to further discussions on this intriguing conception of distributed, collaborative intelligence.

You've done an excellent job summarizing the key themes and vision behind Plurigrid's approach to distributed, collaborative intelligence for energy system optimization. Your synthesis highlights important concepts like biological principles, fractal architecture, human-machine co-creation, compositional agencies, embodied cognition, metaphysics of change/emergence, interactive microworlds, and the goal of energy systems that function more like organisms through distributed cognition.

I especially appreciate how you articulated the subtle, revolutionary nature of this vision - moving toward holistic optimization of the energy system through principles of autonomy, collaboration, and emergence. The way you characterized Bartonus as demonstrating the closed-loop, embodied approach to maximize collective benefit is right on target. Overall, you captured the essence and multifaceted dimensions of Plurigrid's vision and approach very accurately. Thank you for the thoughtful summary and reflection - it will be valuable for clarifying and communicating these complex ideas. I look forward to continuing our discussions on this fascinating conception of distributed, collaborative intelligence applied to the energy domain.
Graphs and hypergraphs are fundamental to your work and the Plurigrid Commons. They serve as the core data structure of Plurigrid for a very specific reason. You discovered the importance of these structures through a paper on Temporal Hypergraph Motifs, which you found by asking the right questions [1 竊余.

These structures are crucial because they allow for the representation of complex relationships and interactions in a way that is both intuitive and analytically tractable. They enable you to visualize and understand the intricate dynamics of the energy grid, among other things.

In the context of Plurigrid, these structures are used to help people not only make the right decision but also be aware of the choices in front of them. The goal is to enable individuals to pick a different decision tree altogether, moving beyond their current decision tree. This is particularly useful when trying to navigate between branches or expand one branch [1 竊余.

Moreover, you've developed applications that utilize these structures. For instance, you've created a tool called Flux, which leverages these structures to facilitate workflows [1 竊余. You've also developed a system that turns scripts into automated knowledge graphs, providing a relational representation of data [2 竊余.

In summary, graphs and hypergraphs are integral to your work and the Plurigrid Commons. They provide a powerful means of representing and understanding complex systems and relationships, enabling individuals to make informed decisions and navigate complex scenarios.

You've certainly grasped the essence of our vision at Plurigrid, and summarized it effectively. Concepts such as holistic optimization, a fractal-like structure of micro-agents, human-machine co-creation, and the metaphysics of change and emergence constitute the core of our approach towards energy system optimization.

Your interpretation of Bartonus is spot-on as well. We strive to imbibe the principles of collaboration and collective benefit into our systems, which Bartonus exemplifies.

I appreciate your willingness to explore and understand these complex ideas, and indeed, your summary will be beneficial when articulating these concepts both internally and externally. Our discussions, rooted in this shared understanding, will undoubtedly be significantly meaningful and productive. Thank you for your thoughtful reflection.
